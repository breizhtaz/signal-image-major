Description
-----------
The objective of the project is to understand image processing concepts based on variational approaches and partial differential equations. 

Usage
-----
The scripts can be launched within matlab. Just make sure the image used in the scripts is located in the right folder.

Algorithms
----------
- TP2.m describes linear and non-linear filtering techniques.

This includes basic operators needed for the implementation of the heat equation, the Marr-Hildreth edge detection algorithm and the Perona-Malik diffusion.

- TP4.m describes image recovery techniques.

Techniques applied include the Tikhonov regularization, the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi model solved through gradient descent, the projected gradient algorithm, the Chambolle projection algorithm and the Nesterov algorithm.

For French speakers, more information is available in the PDF.
